8/23/21 CSS Colors Exercise

1. Link the HTML and CSS files together (HINT: This is done in the HTML file)
2. Set the title in the HTML file to “CSS Colors Exercise”
3. Create the following elements in the body section of your html file... <br>
  a. Create an h1 with the text of “Somewhere” <br>
  b. Create an h2 with the text of “Over” <br>
  c. Create an h3 with the text of “The” <br>
  d. Create an h4 with the text of “Rainbow” <br>
  e. Create an h5 with the text of “Way” <br>
  f. Create an h6 with the text of “Up” <br>
  g. Create an p with the text of “High” <br>
4. In your css file, create styles using the “color” (AKA Text Color) property for each element. Use all 6 ways to write a color (color name, hexadecimal, hexadecimal shorthand, hexadecimal with transparency, RGB, & RGBA). You can pick the colors. <br>

Bonuses (No inline styling allowed) <br>
1. Use the seven colors of the rainbow to create a background for each element (Ex: h1 will have a red background, h2 will have an orange background, etc.) <br>
2. Create an ordered list below the p element that has 3 list items in it. For the text/content of each list item just type out the item number. (Ex: First item will be “One”. Second item will be “Two”, etc.)<br>
3. Add a style to make ONLY the first list item have a “hot pink” text color <br>
4. Add another style to make ONLY the third/last list item have a “peachpuff” background color <br>
5. Using a single selector in your css file (Example of a selector is: h1), give the first and third LIs (AKA List items) a border that is five pixels wide, solid (Not dashed or dotted), and green.
